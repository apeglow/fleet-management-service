# fleet-management-service


## System requirements:

- Java 8
- Maven 3


### Linux

After checkout you fill find an executable named __fleetmanagement__ in the root folder. 

./fleetmanagement src/test/resources/example1.json
./fleetmanagement src/test/resources/example2.json


### Any other OS

Run 

mvn package
java -cp target/fleet-management-service-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar de.apeglow.fleetmanagement.service.FleetmanagementServiceApplication src/test/resources/example1.json

java -cp target/fleet-management-service-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar de.apeglow.fleetmanagement.service.FleetmanagementServiceApplication src/test/resources/example2.json




## Task

You are given a []int scooters, which has as many elements as there are

districts in Berlin that Coup operates in. For each i, scooters[i] is the

number of scooters in that district (0-based index).

During a work day, scooters are maintained (batteries changed, cleaned,

checked for damages) by the Fleet Manager (FM) and possibly other Fleet

Engineers (FEs). Each FE, as well as the FM, can only maintain scooters in

one district. Additionally, there is a limit on how many scooters a single

FE may supervise: the FM is able to maintain up to C scooters, and a FE is

able to maintain up to P scooters. Each scooter has to be maintained by some FE or the FM.

How do we solve the problem?

Find the minimum number of FEs which are required to help the FM so that every scooter in

each district of Berlin is maintained. Note that you may choose which district the FM should

go to.

Input / Output

As input you are given the []int scooters, int C and int P

Result should be int - the minimum number of FEs which are required to help the FM

Constraints

[]scooters will contain between 1 and 100 elements.

Each element in scooters will be between 0 and 1000.

C will be between 1 and 999.

P will be between 1 and 1000.

Examples

1)

input:

{ scooters: [15, 10],

C: 12,

P: 5

}

expected output:

{ fleet_engineers: 3 }

2)

input:

{ scooters: [11, 15, 13],

C: 9,

P: 5

}

expected output:

{ fleet_engineers: 7 }
